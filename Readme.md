# Custom Electron File Save Dialogs

An angular application running in Electron that downloads a file from a server and then presents custom dialogs
so that the file can only be saved to a USB drive.

## Getting Started

Both the Electron / Angular client and the node server must be running.

### Installing

Run 'npm install' in both the client and the server folders.

## Runing the server.
'npm start" in the server directory.

## Running the client.
The client requires two steps:
1) Start the angular application with 'npm start'.
2) Start the electron application with 'npm run start-electron'.
